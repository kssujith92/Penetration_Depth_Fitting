# Penetration_Depth_Fitting
 Fitting of superfluid density data obtained from penetration depth using different superconducting gap models.

 Single gap fitting fits the data to an 's-wave' or a 'd-wave' model.
 
 Multi-gap fitting fits the data to 's+s', 's+d', or 'd+d' models.

 Run 'main_code.m' in the respective folders and follow the prompts. More documentation in the code as comments.
